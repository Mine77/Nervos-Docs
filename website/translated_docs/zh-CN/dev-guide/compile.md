> For CentOS user, here's a [guidance](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/issues/626) for you.

## Build

Here we build from the source code on `master` branch, which is the latest release version. For other versions and branches, please check the [CKB repo](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb) for more information.

Get the source code:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb.git && \
cd ckb && \
git checkout master
```

Build it:

```shell
make build
```

You will find the generated executable binary in `target/release/ckb` folder.

Then you need to move it to a `PATH` directory:

```shell
sudo ln -snf "$(pwd)/target/release/ckb" /usr/local/bin/ckb
```

Then check if it works with:

```shell
ckb --version
```
